**Never miss another message from a customer in Microsoft Teams**

<Warning>
    Microsoft Teams integration is currently in beta. The integration won't currently be available for your workspace until we've enabled the feature flag.

    If you need any assistance or have feedback on the installation process please [reach out to us](mailto:help@plain.com)!

</Warning>

Our Microsoft Teams integration lets you sync messages from selected Teams channels to Plain and respond directly to customers from the platform.

### Prerequisites

For the integration you'll need:

- A Teams account with at least one seat
- The installation of the app for teams can only be perfomed by an admin as you may need to change settings to:
  - [Allow external apps to be installed](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/manage/external-app-setup?view=o365-worldwide)
  - [Allow external users to be added as guests to be invited to Teams](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/solutions/collaborate-as-team)

        </Warning>

        #### Option 1 - Install via Teams App
        - Navigate to the Apps tab
        - Click Manage your apps
        - Click Upload an app
        - As a Teams admin, you should be able to 'Upload an app to your organisation's app catalogue' and upload the app you downloaded in the previous step

        #### Option 2 - Install via the [Teams Admin Dashboard](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/dashboard)
        - In the left sidebar, navigate to Teams apps -> Manage Apps
        - Under Actions, click on 'Upload new app'

    </Step>

</Steps>

## Using the app

The app must be added to a channel that allows guests where you would like to provide customer support. To start helping customers, you need to do a few things:

[//]: # ' Video to be exported from screentudio'

Once you've set up your channel, you need to add guests to the channel. To do this directly from teams, by right-clicking on the Team name in the teams list, and clicking 'Add member'.

## How threads are created from Teams

You should now have a channel with the Plain app installed, with _users_ and _guests_. The integration works as follows

- Only posts **created by guests** will create a new thread in Plain
- Reply messages to threads **created by guests** will be ingested by both **users and guests**

## Responding to customers

To respond to customers, you can do so directly from the Plain app in Teams.

If the user has a personal Teams integration (see below) then the message will be sent as that user:

![User Reply](/public/images/ms-teams-int-user-reply.png)

If the user does not have a personal Teams integration, we will send the message as the bot, impersonating the user, which will look something like the below:

![Impersonated Reply](/public/images/ms-teams-int-impersonated-reply.png)

## Authorise Teams users in Plain

Its recommended that anyone with a Teams seat follows the below steps to allow Plain to reply as their teams user. It also allows attributing any messages they send in the Teams channel to be associated with their Plain user.

To link a Teams account with a Plain user account, navigate to Â **`Settings`**Â >Â **`Microsoft Teams`** and click, **`Authorise replies`** to start the authorisation flow.
