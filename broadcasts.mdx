## Getting started

### Define an audience

Audiences let you group your customers so that you can control who messages get sent to.

In order to add a channel to an audience you need to add the Plain app to it in Slack first. If you can't see a channel you expect to, try hitting the refresh icon next to the search box to refresh the available channels.

### Create a broadcast

Broadcasts are the messages and updates which you send out to customers. You can construct your broadcast out of all the blocks you would expect such as:

- text
- headings
- lists
- images
- code blocks
- and more!

To insert emojis try using your system emoji picker e.g `ctrl + cmd + space` on Mac or `Windows key + ;` on Windows.
