**Never miss another message from a customer in Microsoft Teams**

<Warning>
  Microsoft Teams support is only available in our [Scale tier](https://www.plain.com/pricing). If
  you'd like to use our Teams integration to consolidate your support stack â€“ [you can book a demo

  show you around.
</Warning>

Our Microsoft Teams integration lets you sync messages from selected Teams channels to Plain and respond directly to customers from the platform.

- Install the Plain app in Microsoft Teams
- Invite guests

Once this is set up, the integration allows you to:

- Respond to teams messages in Plain
- Sync messages from selected Teams channels to Plain
- Reply as your Teams user from Plain

Here's a quick demo of the Plain Microsoft Teams integration in action, to get started, see the [installation guide](./microsoft-teams/installation).
